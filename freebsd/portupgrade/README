This package provider is a full replacement for the default ones provided
by the main puppet distribution for freebsd.

Deployment is probably best done with the plugin sync feature of puppet.

Prerequist is the portupgrade port needs to be installed.

Assuming: MODULEDIR=/usr/local/etc/puppet/module

1) Place file (portupgrade.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/provider/package

2) Make sure "pluginsync = true" is in your puppet.conf file

3) Reference with provider => portupgrade and use the port origin as the name:

eg:
class bash {
        package { "shells/bash":
                provider => portupgrade,
                alias   => "bash",
                ensure  => latest,
        }
}
