Directory:

portupgrade:	(puppet ticket #3793)
	A rewrite of the freebsd package provider
	to support the "portupgrade" package/port
	manager that's popular on freebsd.  Note
	that this provider actually compiles the
	software on the client machine.  Uses the
	port origin as the internal name.
	

tool-port2module:
	A simple shell script to build a puppet modules
	directory structure from currently installed
	ports.

fbsd:		(puppet ticket #5951)
	A rewrite of the freebsd package provider
	to support .tbz files (precompiled ports) using
	the port origin as the internal name.

rcconf:
	A totally new type + providers for managing
	freebsd rc.conf files.  "sysrc" provider uses the sysrc
	script/application (http://druidbsd.sourceforge.net/)
	"freebsd" provider is a very quick and dirty
	version based off some puppet code I saw.
