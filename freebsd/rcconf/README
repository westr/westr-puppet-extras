This new package/type provider is for managing Freebsd style
rc.conf configuration files.

Since it's a type, you're able to properly do dependencies/etc with it.

How to use:

1) Place file (type/rcconf.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/type/rcconf.rb

2) Place file (provider/rcconf.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/provider/rcconf.rb

3) Place files (provider/rcconf/*.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/provider/rcconf/*.rb

A) Make sure "pluginsync = true" is in your puppet.conf file

Use as:

class testconf {
	rcconf { "conf_enable":
		provider => sysrc,
		value    => "YES",
		rcfile   => "/etc/rc.conf.local",
	}
}
