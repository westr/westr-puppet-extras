This is a new "type" which is for specifically managing Freebsd style
rc.conf configuration files. (key="value" style)

Since it's a type, you're able to properly do dependencies/etc with it.

The (included) first provider for the type is called "sysrc" which uses the app/script
available at http://druidbsd.sourceforge.net/ - also the default one so you don't need to edit it.



How to use:

1) Place file (type/rcconf.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/type/rcconf.rb

2) Place file (provider/rcconf.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/provider/rcconf.rb

3) Place files (provider/rcconf/*.rb) in $MODULEDIR/<custom>/lib/puppet/provider/rcconf/*.rb

4) Make sure "pluginsync = true" is in your puppet.conf file



Use as:
value  = whatever you want - set to :nil to force a blank value (ie: key="")
rcfile = use a specific file, otherwise it'll update the key wherever it finds it.

class testconf {
	rcconf { "test_enable":
		provider => sysrc,
		value    => "YES",
		rcfile   => "/etc/rc.conf.local",
	}
	rcconf { "test_flags":
		provider => sysrc,
		value    => "--help -flag -item",
		rcfile   => "/etc/rc.conf",
	}
}
