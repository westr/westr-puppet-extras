Mkport.sh:	This is a simple script that takes 2 variables: portname + portorigin and
		then creates a module for the port with the structure and a basic init.pp
		file.  If the port is installed locally already, it'll source the options
		file and any port pre-reqs.

Mkport-all.sh:	Simple wrapper script that does all the currently installed ports on the
		machine via the above script.  Good for adding a pre-existing non-puppet
		controlled machine.
